Little Intro
As the First War was finished, the Human lands in the south lay in ruins. The
powers of the Azerothians were not enough to protect their lands. While
planning new strategies to get back the lands of the South, new buildings
were devised. Their new allies, the Dwarves and Elves also brought some of
their building plans over for use by the Alliance. Peasants work hard in the
creation of these buildings.

Gold Cost: 1,200
Lumber Cost: 800
Armor: 20
Requirements: None

The Town Hall provides 5 supply points.

Options:
Train Peasant
Upgrade to Keep (Requires Barracks)

The Town Hall is the most important building of all, because without it, you
would not be able to collect gold, a important resource. The Town Hall is the
only place where you get build Peasants. The Town Hall should be guarded all
the time by other units and also should be at the center of your town. Make
sure that the Town Hall is placed as close as possible to the closest Gold
Mine and that you have two by the time you need to upgrade one since
upgrading makes the Town Hall not be able to make Peasants.

----
Keep

Visual Range: 6
HP: 1,400
Build Time: 200
Gold Cost: 2,000
Lumber Cost: 1,000
Oil Cost: 200

The Keep makes every gold returned by a Peasant have a +10 bonus.

Options:
Train Peasant
Upgrade to Castle (Requires Lumber Mill, Blacksmith, Stables)

The Keep is just like the Town Hall, except stronger and a better visual
range. You should only make Keeps in developed cities, not unguarded or wild
expansions.

------
Castle

Build Time: 200
Gold Cost: 2,500
Lumber Cost: 1,200
Oil Cost: 500
Armor: 20
Requirements: Lumber Mill, Blacksmith, Stables

The Keep makes every gold returned by a Peasant have a +20 bonus.

Options:
Train Peasant

The final level of the Town Hall, it is the strongest and the one with the
most vision. You should only build Castles at major cities, like your first
city.

----
Farm

Visual Range: 3
HP: 400
Build Time: 100
Gold Cost: 500
Lumber Cost: 250
Armor: 20
Requirements: None

The Farm provides 5 supply points.

You build farms so you gain supply units to build units. You can use farms
to block up choke points or to use as cover for towers. Use make sure you
have a surplus so when you lose farms, you don't lose the ability to make
units.

--------
Barracks

Visual Range: 3
HP: 800
Build Time: 200
Gold Cost: 700
Lumber Cost: 450
Armor: 20

Options:
Train Footman
Train Archer (Requires Lumber Mill)
Train Ranger (Overrides Archer, Requires Keep, Lumber Mill, Ranger Upgrade)
Build Ballista (Requires Lumber Mill, Blacksmith)
Train Knight (Requires Stables)
Train Paladin (Overrides Knight, Requires Stables, Church, Paladin Upgrade)

The Barracks is where you can make the basic fighting units. You will only
be able to make the Footman at first, but after you build the right
buildings, you can make the more advanced fighting units. Footmen are good
in early attacking, but knights and archers should be used as the game goes
on.

-----------------
Elven Lumber Mill

Visual Range: 3
HP: 600
Build Time: 150
Gold Cost: 600
Lumber Cost: 450
Armor: 20

The Elven Lumber Mill makes every lumber returned by a Peasant have a +25
bonus.

Upgrade Arrows 1 (Damage +1, Build Time: 200, Gold: 300, Lumber: 300)

Longbow Research (Range +1, Build Time: 250, Gold: 2,000)
Marksmanship Research (Damage +3, Build Time: 250, Gold: 2,500)

The Lumber Mill should be built near trees that are far away from your Town
Hall, but still in your city. Peasants will bring their lumber to the Lumber
Mill instead of the Town Hall if the Mill is closer. Also, the Lumber Mill
is a requirement for many of the advanced buildings and it also has some
good Archer upgrades.

----------

Build Time: 200
Gold Cost: 800
Lumber Cost: 450
Oil Cost: 100

a lot between winning and losing. Make sure to upgrade when resources and
time allow.

-----------
Scout Tower

Visual Range: 9
HP: 100
Build Time: 60
Gold Cost: 550
Lumber Cost: 200
Armor: 20
Requirements: None

Options:
Upgrade to Guard Tower (Requires Lumber Mill)
Upgrade to Cannon Tower (Requires Blacksmith)

You should only build Scout Towers so you can upgrade them. Building just
Scout Towers is a waste of resources and space. All they can do is see far,
and that isnt a good reason to build them.

-----------
Guard Tower

Visual Range: 9
HP: 130
Build Time: 140
Gold Cost: 500
Lumber Cost: 150
Armor: 20
Requirements: Lumber Mill
Basic Damage: 4
Piercing Damage: 12
Effective Damage: 6-16
Attack Range: 6

Guard Towers are good for defending since they do not do splash damage and
that they can attack air units. The range is good too, but not as much as a
Ballista/Catapult. Their HP total is lower than a Cannon Tower though.

------------
Cannon Tower

Visual Range: 9
HP: 160
Build Time: 190
Gold Cost: 1,000
Lumber Cost: 300
Armor: 20
Requirements: Blacksmith
Basic Damage: 50
Piercing Damage: 0
Effective Damage: 10-50
Attack Range: 7

Cannon Towers are good since they do a lot more damage than a Guard Tower.
However, it does splash damage so it can hurt units that are near the blast
(even allies). The range is still not longer than that of a
Ballista/Catapult and it cannot attack air units.

-------
Stables

Visual Range: 3
HP: 500
Build Time: 150
Gold Cost: 1,000
Lumber Cost: 300
Armor: 20
Requirements: Keep

Build the Stables as soon as you make the Keep so you can build Knights.
Knights are very important in the ground fight.

------
Church

Visual Range: 3
HP: 700
Build Time: 175
Gold Cost: 900
Lumber Cost: 500
Armor: 20
Requirements: Castle

Options:
Paladin Training (Build Time: 250, Gold: 1,000)
Research Healing (Build Time: 200, Gold: 1,000)
Reserach Exorcism (Build Time: 200, Gold: 2,000)

The Church should be built as soon as you make the Castle. The ability to
have Paladin is very important. The spells they have can change the flow of
battle to your advantage due to the spells the Paladin have.

----------------
Gnomish Inventor

Visual Range: 3
HP: 500
Build Time: 150
Gold Cost: 1,000
Lumber Cost: 400
Armor: 20
Requirements: Keep

Options:
Build Flying Machine
Train Dwarven Demolition Squad

The Gnomish Inventor is important since you can make the flying scout as well
as the suicide bomber. Both are fun to use and deploy and the bomber can
wreck havoc on enemy buildings.

----------
Mage Tower

Visual Range: 3
HP: 500
Build Time: 125
Gold Cost: 1,000
Lumber Cost: 200
Armor: 20
Requirements: Castle

Options:

Research Flame Shield (Build Time: 100, Gold: 1,000)
Research Invisibility (Build Time: 200, Gold: 2,500)
Research Polymorph (Build Time: 200, Gold: 2,000)
Research Blizzard (Build Time: 200, Gold: 2,000)

The Mage Tower is very important to you at the Castle Stage. The battle will
go from the ground to air and magic. Whoever gets Magic first and uses it
well will most likely win the war.

--------------
Gryphon Aviary

Visual Range: 3
HP: 500
Build Time: 150
Gold Cost: 1,000
Lumber Cost: 400
Armor: 20

The second part of the Castle battles are the Air. The Gryphon Riders are
slow to build and expensive, but when made, are a powerful ally. Make sure
not to lose this building.

Armor: 20
Requirements: Lumber Mill

Build Transport (Requires Foundry)
Build Battleship (Requires Foundry)
Build Gnomish Submarine (Requires Gnomish Inventor)

You will only build Shipyards if needed. On island map, power over the seas
is critcal. Also note this is where Oil Tankers will return Oil so build it
close to Oil spots until a Refinery can be built. Build as many of these
across the shore as possible so you can build as many ships as possible.

Upgrade Ship Armor 2 (Armor +5, Build Time: 250, Gold: 1,500, Lumber: 900)

The Foundry is important since you can upgrade your ships and make the
advanced ships. Build the Foundry as soon as Oil allows.

------------
Oil Refinery

Visual Range: 3
HP: 600
Build Time: 225
Gold Cost: 800
Lumber Cost: 350
Oil Cost: 200
Armor: 20
Requirements: Shipyard

The Oil Refinery makes every oil barrel brought back by a Oil Tanker have a
+25 bonus.

The Oil Refinery should be built at far away Oil Spots so your Oil Tankers
will not have to go far to return oil.

------------
Oil Platform

Visual Range: 3
HP: 650
Build Time: 200
Gold Cost: 700
Lumber Cost: 450
Armor: 20
Requirements: Oil Tanker

Protect these as much as you can. Damage done to these cannot be healed, so
if your Oil Platform is at red, decide if it is worth the risk of protecting.
